### History

Bindery.js 1.0 was developed in Spring 2014 for [for/with/in](http://htmloutput.risd.gd),
a publication from participants in the graphic design course _HTML Output_ at [RISD](http://risd.edu). It was based on the [much-maligned](https://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmful), [now abandoned](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/google-plans-to-dump-adobe-css-tech-to-make-blink-fast-not-rich) CSS Regions spec, using [a polyfill](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-regions-polyfill). [Catherine Leigh Schmidt](http://cath.land) and [Lukas WinklerPrins](http://ltwp.net) produced a Jekyll theme called [Baby Bindery](https://github.com/thedesignoffice/babybindery) for the [Design Office](http://thedesignoffice.org/) based on this initial version.

Bindery.js 2.0 has been developed since February 2017 by [Evan Brooks](https://evanbrooks.info). It has been rewritten from scratch to be smaller, faster, more flexible, and more robust. With thanks to [John Caserta](http://johncaserta.com/) and [Teddy Bradford](https://teddybradford.com/) for contributions and feedback.

### Principles

1. _Programmatic over precise_: Bindery is intended for people who are interested in creating layouts
   with systems and rules. It's not a direct-manipulation tool like InDesign.
2. _Built for today_: Bindery's makes it easy to get started with HTML and CSS, but further customization requires javascript. That could change if browser makers adopt new standards like [CSS Paged Media Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/) and [CSS Generated Content ](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/).
3. _Don't reinvent the wheel_: Bindery relies on your browser's PDF generation. If you want to adjust a PDF setting, your browser must support itâ€” different browsers and platforms may have different options.
