# Make a printable book with HTML & CSS

*Bindery.js* is an open-source javascript library for designing printable books with a web browser. 

First, Bindery divides your content into multiple pages. Design each page with running headers, spreads, footnotes, and more. Generate page numbers for a table of contents or index. When you're ready to print, you can configure bleed, crop marks, and booklet ordering.

If you're a web designer, you can think about books as an extension of responsive design. If you're a print designer, you can express layouts programmatically, without the need for InDesign.
