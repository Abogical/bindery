*Bindery.js* is a library for designing printable books with HTML and CSS.

At its simplest, Bindery flows content over multiple pages. From there, the designer can create elements that depend on that flow, like running headers, footnotes, tables of contents, and indexes. Bindery also provides print options like bleed, crop marks, and booklet ordering.

Bindery is intended to let web designers think about book design as an extension of the responsive web, and let print designers express sophisticated book layouts programmatically, without opening InDesign.
